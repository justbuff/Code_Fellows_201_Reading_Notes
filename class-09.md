# Understanding SOPs

A Standard Operating Proceedure (SOP) is a company-specific procedure that documents what is necessary to complete a task. A SOP should answer the what, when, and why of what needs to be done. SOPs enforce Policies (overarching guidance) and encourage consistency. Writing formats for SOP are not standard and can be adopted to indidual organizations, but can become out of date quickly and must be maintained.

SOPs must be:
- Readable (organized and legible)
- Consumable (easy-to-read format)
- Understandable (focused, relevant, and simple)
- Actionable (clearly describe what is to be done)
- Measurable (activities described must be specific and measurable)

Writing a SOP should begin with a simple flowchart to map the steps of the activity from beginning to end. Next any closely-related topics should be combined for readability. The level of detail should be within five to seven steps. Lastly there should be a brief opening paragraph that describes the SOP and its inputs, outputs, expected results, and involved roles. 

SOPs should:
- be simple
- be portable
- tell a story with their flowcharts and diagrams
- be consistent
- be accessible to their audience
