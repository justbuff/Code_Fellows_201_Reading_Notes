# Introduction to pfSense

pfSense is a free, customized distribution of FreeBSD (OS) that can virtualize a router and firewall. pfSense can easily be installed and maintained and can be adapted to several applications, such as a home router or a corporate firewall. Popular uses for pfSense include:
- LAN/WAN Router
- VPN Router
- Wireless Hotspot (Captive Portal)
- Firewall
- DHCP/DNS Server
- Wireless Access Point
- Port Forwarding/NAT

## Why Use pfSense?

pfSense is fast, free, customizable, and stable. pfSense can replace an existing router that does not offer the same features or peformance.

## Embedded Installation

pfSense can also be installed on several embedded platforms, which are a good option for creating a small, low-powered appliance to run a network. 

## Getting Started with pfSense

A computer with at least two network cards is required to setup a pfSense router. Download and install the pfSense program (ISO or USB file). Boot to the file and follow the prompts provided to set up and customize your install. Support is available on the pfSense forums, mailing list, and IRC.
