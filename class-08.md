# Windows Registry

The Windows Registry is a database on Windows machines where Windows and many other programs store their configuration settings. The registry can be changed to edit existing options and enable hidden features (registry hacks). 

Windows Registry can be accessed by running the Registry Editor program. As a collection of databases, both system-wide and user-specific registry settings are saved. Signing into Windows loads the settings from these files into memory. 
>"When you launch a program, it can check the registry stored in memory to find its configuration settings. When you change a programâ€™s settings, it can change the settings in the registry. When you sign out of your PC and shut down, it saves the state of the registry to the disk." (https://www.howtogeek.com/370022/windows-registry-demystified-what-you-can-do-with-it/)

Windows Registry is comprised of folder-like "keys" containing "values" of data. Groups of keys and values are called "hives". Programs can store all, some, or none of their settings into the registry. The registry should be treated with caution, as chenges to system critical settings can cause errors or even an unbootable PC. The registry can be backed up before any changes are made. 

Specific settings can be accessed by following the registry hack instructions or pasting the complete address into the Registry Editors address bar. Double clicking a value will open it to be edited, while right clicking the pane can be used to create a new value. Downloading trusted .reg files is another way of editing the registry. 

## Things I want to know more about

I would like to understand how hidden settings are found and hacked.
