# Windows PowerShell

PowerShell is a command-line shell interface made by Microsoft. PowerShell lets admins to manage computers from the command line. As a scripting language, PowerShell is built on .NET which can be used for automating administrative tasks and configuration management. PowerShell is an interpreted language for doing things, typically in the context of managing a technology environment.

PowerShell tasks are generally performed using cmdlets which can perform a wide variety of actions. These cmdlets can perform something as simple as evaluating the size of a file, to spinning up hundreds of servers in the cloud.

# PowerShell being used by hackers

IBM's X-Force found that in 2018 just 43 per cent of the attacks it analyzed utilized any sort of locally installed files. Rather the hackers used PowerShell scripts to execute commands in memory without significantly touching file systems.

As with local malware infections, the attacker first needs to get the ability to run malicious commands. The hacker does not direct the infected Windows machine to download, save, and execute a trojan payload but instead the attack runs entirely in memory using PowerShell, where it can be used to do anything from harvest and steal passwords to mine cryptocurrency. It is possible to wrap protections around PowerShell to stop it being hacked, such as requiring scripts to be digitally signed.
