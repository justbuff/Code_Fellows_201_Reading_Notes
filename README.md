Windows System Restore allows a user to revert the OS back to a previous state by saving some of the system files and the Windows registry as Restore Points. 
"When an install failure or data corruption occurs, System Restore can return a system to working condition without you having to reinstall the operating system." (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/what-is-system-restore-a9d1b33f-1df9-e0f2-8aa3-d904cd940ee4)
To navigate to System Restore in Windows 10/11, go to Control Panel > System and Security > System > System protection > System properties. This menu provides access to System Restore, Configure, and Create. System Restore has the saved Restore Points for the user to select and restore the system. Configure lets the user activate or deactivate system protection and allocate disk space usage for Restore Points. Create makes a Restore Point for the drives with system protection enabled.
When completing a system restore it is important to not turn off the computer during the restoration process. If the system restore did not correct the issue, an older Restore Point can be used.

GitHub (www.github.com) is a code hosting platorm which lets users create, store, and manage code repositories. GitHub has a large community which allows a users code to gain exposure and critique. GitHub is powered by an open source version control system called Git, which is accessed from a users PC and can be downloaded for free. Git can be used on the Windows desktop by downlaoding Git Bash which provides emulation for the Git command line. A user can create repositories on their GitHub profile (beginning with the + drop down menu) to write and save code. Repositories can be made publicly accessible or private. 
Visual Studio Code is a source code editor that runs on a users desktop and is available for free download on Windows, Mac, and Linux. VSC comes with support for Javascript, Typescript, and Node.js and can enable further code languages via extensions, such as Python and C++.
