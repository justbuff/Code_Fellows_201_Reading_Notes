# Troubleshooting Techniques

In the IT profession, troubleshooting is a common occurance and entails solving problems. The troubleshooting process can be used to solve problems both in and outside the IT environment.
The first step in troubleshooting involves identifying the problem and its associated information. The ability to duplicate the problem is a plus. A typical problem is usually multifaceted, and all parts of the problem should be documented and if needed approached seperately. Asking the user as many questions about the problem as possible is necessary to get the proper details from the users perspective.

The next step is identying what could have caused the problem. While the simplest explanation is often the correct one, every possible scenario should be considered. Create a list of potential solutions and begin with the most basic. Implemement the solution that does work by having a primary and backup plans. If the entire list is used and there is still no solution, calling an expert is the best bet. After the solution has been applied, the problem still needs to be tested to make sure it was resolved. 

Finally, the entire troubleshooting process should be thoroughly documented as a preventative measure and in case anyone else encounters the same problem.
