IT staff are vital in the operation and avalibility of technology systems. IT staff include those who work directly with users and customers, and those who keep servers and network infrastructure running. IT professionals must be mindful of their interactions with customers, as they represent their respective company. In this sense, IT staff must have both soft and hard skills. 

The help desk is the first line of support for customers, as it is contacted first for assistance. Help desk professionals must have technical knowledge and the ability to troubleshoot. Good communication skills are needed to provide assistance to customers while maintaining the positive image of the company.
