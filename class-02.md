# GitHub and Visual Studio Code

GitHub (www.github.com) is a code hosting platorm which lets users create, store, and manage code repositories. GitHub has a large community which allows a users code to gain exposure and critique. GitHub is powered by an open source version control system called Git, which is accessed from a users PC and can be downloaded for free. Git can be used on the Windows desktop by downlaoding Git Bash which provides emulation for the Git command line. A user can create repositories on their GitHub profile (beginning with the + drop down menu) to write and save code. Repositories can be made publicly accessible or private. 

Visual Studio Code is a source code editor that runs on a users desktop and is available for free download on Windows, Mac, and Linux. VSC comes with support for Javascript, Typescript, and Node.js and can enable further code languages via extensions, such as Python and C++.
