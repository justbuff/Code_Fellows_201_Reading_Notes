# Malware Remediation Tools and Techniques

PCs with malware exhibit several signs: slower-than-usual performance, a sudden spate of pop-ups, and other anomalous issues. To remedy the presense of malware these steps should be followed:

- Enter safe mode. Disconnect PC from internet and boot into Safe Mode. In Windows 10, hold down the Shift key and click Reboot, then from the menu select Restart. On the next menu that appears choose #4 for Safe Mode. 
- Delete temporary files. In Safe Mode run Disk Cleanup to remove temporary files. 
- Download malware scanners. Scan for malware with the  antivirus software of your choice.
- Run a scan with Malwarebytes. As an example, the free trial of Malwarebytes can be downloaded, installed, and used to scan the computer.
- Fix your web browser. Before launching your web browser, check your homepage and connection settings.
- Recover your files if Windows is corrupt. If Windows still isn’t working properly, you may have to reinstall Windows. Before wiping your hard drive, copy all of your files to an external USB or flash drive. Once you have backed up everything, reinstall Windows either from the disc that came with your PC, by downloading the installation image from Microsoft, or by using your PC’s factory restore option if applicable.
- Keep your PC clean. Always make sure that you have a real-time antivirus program running on your PC. Further options include website blocking software and running your web browser in sandbox mode.
